collisions finally work (for the most part), and are a lot more efficient.
before BSP i was getting 20fps, because collisions would search through every single face in the scene, now I'm getting 6000fps, which is a 300x speedup
There are still bugs, some faces aren't included and some faces collide on the wrong side.
This will be fixed soon.

TODO :
	Scene refactor:
		Incorporate multiple objects into one bsp collision tree.
		Store it in "Scene"
		Rename "Scene" to "Level", allow switching between levels.

Whats next:
	A quick refactor, mainly of the math library and gameplay-based code.
	My own level, no more shittily textured dust2
	A HUD, including player-bound objects such as hands.
	A renderer overhaul, new shaders and render pipeline that will give my game a unique aesthetic.
	
	Physics, kill me
	menus w/ text
	gameplay
	A huge optimization stage, will rewrite many of the inefficient algorithms.

	Finally multiplayer.


I expect to be done some time in the summer, but will continue development and refactoring intermittently until I'm happy.

When I have free time I will refactor this into a real game, and publish it on steam.
