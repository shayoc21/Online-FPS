Have done a small graphics rewrite, added an obnoxious purple tint over everything and made stuff pixelated. (proof of concept for post processing, as I have introduced a framebuffer)
I also made my own map in trenchbroom, this should allow for extremely fast BSP optimisations in the future, as I can simply store if a partition is "solid", like quake did.

I expect to be done some time in the summer, but will continue development and refactoring intermittently until I'm happy.

When I have free time I will refactor this into a real game, and publish it on steam.
