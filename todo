About 2 weeks ago I finished my collisions, but TWO faces in my scene didnt work.
This was because the raycast would only search faces through my partition, and not the other partitions the ray traverses through.
I've fixed this, now all faces in my scene have collisions

Before BSP optimisation:
	24fps, really slow
After BSP but before thorough raycast:
	6000fps, really fast
Now:
	About 1000fps when constantly moving around, fast enough but not great

For now I am done optimising this, I've never had less fun in my life
I'm going to do a huge refactor now, followed by a graphics overhaul, before finally implementing gameplay and multiplayer.

I expect to be done some time in the summer, but will continue development and refactoring intermittently until I'm happy.

When I have free time I will refactor this into a real game, and publish it on steam.
