i have added bsp, so my level should be partitioned nicely now.

TODO :
	add collisions in a way thats efficient, using the bsp.

	Scene refactor:
		Incorporate multiple objects into one bsp collision tree.
		Store it in "Scene"
		Rename "Scene" to "Level", allow switching between levels.

Whats next:
	A quick refactor, mainly of the math library and gameplay-based code.
	My own level, no more shittily textured dust2
	A HUD, including player-bound objects such as hands.
	A renderer overhaul, new shaders and render pipeline that will give my game a unique aesthetic.

	finally, probably in a couple months, gameplay and multiplayer.
