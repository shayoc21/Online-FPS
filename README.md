Engine development

A 3D first person shooter written in my own engine, developed entirely from scratch in C, only using a handful of low level dependencies (stb, glfw, glew).

Excuse my blender skills. Right now textures are all messed up, because I failed to bake correctly in blender, the texture code is working.

Read 'todo' for more detailed info on the project, and where I'm planning to take it.
